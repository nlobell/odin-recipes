        When you think about the best cooks in your life, one of the first people who might pop into your mind is your grandma.   
    </p>
    <p>
        You spent days watching her in the kitchen, whipping up vintage snacks no one makes anymore, 
and creating holiday feasts that could feed <strong>an army</strong>.  
    </p>

    <p>Therefore, we've created a list of <em>scrumptious</em> recipes.</p>
    <p>They're so heartwarming, it's almost like your grandma made them.</p>
